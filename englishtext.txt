A group of divers. have removed, the "ghost nets" that were covering a British submarine in the Ionian Sea off Greece in an attempt to save the marine wildlife that frequent it.
The HMS Perseus, lost during WWII, lies at a depth of 52 metres between the islands of Kefalonia and Zakynthos.
At least 650,000 marine animals die each year by getting trapped in lost fishing gear, which often snags on shipwrecks and reefs.
These so-called “ghost nets” create deadly traps for sea turtles, dolphins, seals and also fish, which cannot free themselves.
Normally hotspots for biodiversity that provide food and shelter to marine life, the wrecks and reefs become dangerous because of the nets.
